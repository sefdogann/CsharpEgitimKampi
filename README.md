# 🚀 C# Training Camp Projects
## This repo contains the first 8 projects I completed during the C# Bootcamp, instructed by Murat Yücedağ. Each project was an important step in my process of learning and improving my ability to apply programming concepts. You can find the details below.
## 📌 Projects
**✨ Project 1: Hello World!** 
**Printing text to the console** <br/>
*I learned the basic printing operations in C# language using Console.WriteLine() command..* 🌍

# ✨ Project 2: Variables
**Data types and variable definition** <br/>
*I created variables and performed operations on different data types such as int, string, double..* 🔢

# ✨ Project 3: Arrays
*Data manipulation with arrays and loops*<br/>
*I learned how to store multiple values ​​in an array and access these values ​​with loops..* 🧩

# ✨ Project 4: Decision Structures (If-Else)
**Conditional statements and decision structures**<br/>
*I created decision mechanisms using if, else if and else structures..* ⚖️

# ✨ Project 5: Loops
**For, while and foreach loops**<br/>
*I automated repetitive processes with loops and processed large data sets.* 🔄

# ✨ Project 6: Methods
**Functional programming**<br/>
*To make the codes more organized, I created methods that take parameters and return results* 🛠️

# ✨ Project 7: Foreach Loop and Exam System
**Foreach loop and avarage calculation**<br/>
*I simulated an exam system that takes students' exam grades and calculates their averages..* 🎓

# ✨Project 8: Functions That Return Values
**Returning data from functions**<br/>
*I developed functions that process the data I receive from the user and return the results..* 🎗️

# 🚀 Forward Looking Plans
**These projects helped me learn the basic concepts of the C# language. I aim to reinforce this knowledge with more complex structures in future projects.**
